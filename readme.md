# wip example bot(s)

for [cordo](https://github.com/Maanex/cordo)

Each example will build on previous examples so make sure to go through them in the right order.

You need to register the commands yourself as of right now. I'll be adding a script for that at some point.

This repo aims to teach cordo in a more interactive way because who likes docs anyway...

Not finished, tutorials 3 and later are not completed (even though tutorial4 has everything you need to know but the learning curve is literally hell because nothing is explained)
